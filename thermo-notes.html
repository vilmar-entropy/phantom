							<h1> 1. BASIC PRINCIPLES, CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS </h1>
							<strong>1.1 Introduction</strong>   
							<span class="eq"><strong class="term">Thermodynamics</strong> involves the storage, 
								transformation, and transfer of energy. Energy is <strong class="term">stored</strong> 
								as internal energy (due to temperature), kinetic energy (due to motion),
								potential energy (due to elevation), and chemical energy (due to chemical
								composition); it is <strong class="term">transformed</strong> from one of these forms
								to another; and it is <strong class="term">transferred</strong> across
								a boundary as either heat or work.
							</span>    <br> <br>
							<strong>1.2 The System and Control Volume</strong>    
							<span class="eq">A <strong class="term">thermodynamic system</strong> is a fixed quantity of matter upon 
								which attention is focused. It is a region enclosed by a specified 
								<strong class="term"> boundaries </strong>, which may be imaginary, either fixed or moving. All
								matter and space external to a system is its <strong class="term"> surroundings </strong>
								.
							</span>   
							<span class="eq">
								Systems may be defined in several ways; for present purposes, we wish to distinguish
								between three kinds. A <strong class="term"> closed system </strong> is one in which
								there is no exchange of matter with the surroundings - mass does not cross its boundaries.
								An <strong class="term"> open system </strong> is one across whose boundaries there is a flow
								of mass. Each may have energy crossing its boundary. An <strong class="term"> isolated system </strong>    
								is one that is completely impervious to its surroundings - neither mass nor energy cross its boundaries.
							</span>   
							<span class="eq">
								In Figure 1.1 let the compressed gas be the system and the movable piston be its boundary. If heat be 
								applied externally to the cylinder, the gas will undergo an increase in temperature, raising the piston.
								With the rise of piston, the boundary moves. Energy (heat and work) crosses the boundary during this process 
								while the mass of gaseous matter remains constant within the system.
							</span> 
							
							<figure class="topimg" id="fig1-1">
								<img src="images/fig1-1.png" alt="image"/>
							</figure>
							
							<br> <span class="eq">
								Often the system under analysis is of open type, as a pump shown in Fig 1.2.
								With open systems we normally specify the boundary as a <strong class="term"> control surface  </strong>
								and the volume encompassed by that surface as the <strong class="term"> control volume </strong>.
								Thus the control volume may be defined as a volume in space in which one has interest for a 
								particular study or analysis. The mass of working substance within the volume may be constant (though
								not the same molecular matter at any given instant) as in the case of pump, or it may be varying as in
								the case of tire undergoing inflation.

							<strong> 1.3 Properties and State of a System </strong> <br>
							<span class="eq">
								A <strong class="term"> property  </strong> is any quantity which serves to describe a system. The 
								<strong class="term">  state </strong> of a system is its condition as described by giving values
								to its properties at a particular instant. 
							</span> <br>
							<span class="eq">
								Properties may be classified as intensive or extensive. <strong class="term">  Intensive properties </strong>
								are independent of the mass; for example, temperature, pressure, density, and the voltage. 
								<strong class="term">  Extensive properties </strong> are dependent upon the mass of the system and
								are total values such as total volume and total internal energy.
							</span> <br>
							<span class="eq">
								If we divide an extensive property by the mass, a <strong class="term">  specific property results. </strong>
								Specific properties are those for a unit mass and are intensive by definition such as specific volume. <br> <br>
								
							</span>
							
							<strong> 1.4 Mass and Weight </strong> <br>
							<span class="eq">
								The <strong class="term">  mass </strong>  of a body is the absolute quantity of matter in it.
								
							</span>
							<span class="eq"> 
								The <strong class="term"> weight  </strong> of a body means the force of gravity $F_g$ on the body.
								
							</span> $$F_g = mg \longrightarrow (1.1)$$
							
							<strong>1.5 Density, Specific Volume, Specific Weight</strong> <br>
							<span class="eq">
								The <strong class="term"> density $\rho$ </strong> of any substance is its mass (not weight) per unit volume.
								
							</span> $$\rho = \frac{m}{V} \longrightarrow (1.2)$$
							<span class="eq">
								The <strong class="term"> specific volume $v$  </strong> is the volume of a unit mass and is the reciprocal 
								of the density. 
							</span> $$ v = \frac{V}{m} = \frac{1}{\rho} \longrightarrow (1.3)$$
							<span class="eq">
								The <strong class="term"> specific weight $\gamma$ </strong> of any substance is the force of gravity on 
								unit volume.
							</span> $$\gamma = \frac{F_g}{V} \longrightarrow (1.4)$$
							<br>
							
							<strong> 1.6 Pressure </strong> <br>
							<span class="eq"> 
								In gases and liquids it is common to call the effect of a normal force acting on an area the <strong class="term"> pressure </strong>
								
							</span>
							<span class="eq">
								The SI unit of pressure is the Pascal (Pa) where 1 Pa = 1 $N/m^2 = 1 kg/{m \cdot s^2} $. The corresponding 
								English unit is $lb_f/ft^2$, although $lb_f/in^2$ (psi) is commonly used.
							</span>
							<span class="eq">
								In the atmosphere pressure varies with elevation. This variation can be expressed mathematically by 
							</span>	$$ P = \gamma h  = \rho gh \longrightarrow (1.5) $$
							
							<span class="eq">
								The standard reference atmospheric pressure is 760 mmHg or 29.92 inHg at 32$^{\circ}$F, or 14.7 psia, or 1 atm, or 101.325 kPa.
							</span>
							<span class="eq">
								In most thermodynamic relations <strong class="term"> absolute pressure </strong> must be used. Absolute pressure is 
								gage pressure plus the local atmospheric prssure:
							</span> $$ P_{abs} = P_{atm} + P_g  \longrightarrow (1.6)$$
							<span class="eq">
								 A negative gage pressure is often called a <strong class="term"> vacuum, and gages </strong>
								 capable of reading negative pressures are <strong class="term"> vacuum gages.</strong>
								A gage pressure of -50 kPa would be referred to as a vacuum of 50kPa, with the sign omitted.
							</span>
							<span class="eq">
								Fig 1.8 shows the relationships between absolute and gage pressure.
